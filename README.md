# Medical_Insurance_Cost_Prediction_ML_Project
This project predicts medical insurance costs based on demographic and health-related attributes using machine learning models. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The project utilizes Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression models for predictions.

## Key Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values and outliers
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Encoding categorical variables

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - One-hot encoding
   - Data splitting into training and testing sets

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained using Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression
   - Model evaluation based on RÂ² score, MAE, and RMSE

4. **Model Persistence**
   - Saved trained models for future use

5. **Predictions**
   - Example of predictions using the saved model
